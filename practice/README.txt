Both Node.js and Node.py serve the same function: 
they both create a RESTful API for managing a collection of books in a library. 
They provide endpoints to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the books. 
Here’s a breakdown of the functionality provided by both examples:

1. Get All Books
Node.js/Express: GET /books
Python/Flask: GET /books
2. Get a Single Book by ID
Node.js/Express: GET /books/:id
Python/Flask: GET /books/<int:book_id>
3. Add a New Book
Node.js/Express: POST /books
Python/Flask: POST /books
4. Update a Book by ID
Node.js/Express: PUT /books/:id
Python/Flask: PUT /books/<int:book_id>
5. Delete a Book by ID
Node.js/Express: DELETE /books/:id
Python/Flask: DELETE /books/<int:book_id>

Both examples also include error handling to deal with situations 
like trying to access a book that doesn’t exist or server errors. 
They interact with a database to persist the book data.
